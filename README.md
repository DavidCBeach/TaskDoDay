Easily add tasks to day specific todo lists, switch between days, and track your progress. TaskDoDay is task management app that allows you to stay on top of your daily goals. The app allows you to quickly add new tasks to each day and check them off as you complete them.

If you find you have a hard time remembering to complete your daily goals this app is perfect for you. You can set up a daily reminder that will notify you of the tasks you haven't gotten around to finishing yet. Also, if you find that you sometimes procrastinate, this app will help you keep yourself more accountable. By keeping track of how many tasks you complete and don't complete by the end of each day TaskDoDay is able to compile an Overall Task Competition Rate (OTCR). You can easily check on your OTCR in the statistics section of the app. By having a daily updating constant reminder of your own performance you'll be able to have something to work towards and maintain.

There is also an option if you find that you habitually end up putting off tasks to the next day. In the settings you can allow task rollover. This means that at the end of the day all incomplete tasks will automatically transfer over to the next day. This allows you to not forget important tasks while still counting those tasks as incomplete in your OTCR to keep yourself accountable
